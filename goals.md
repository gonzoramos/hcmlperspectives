title: Workshop Goals.
---

Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML) emerges in response to the rapid adoption of ML, to provide the understandings and means to put ML at the service of people in a way that is accessible, useful, and trustworthy to all. This workshopâ€™s goals are to continue [past efforts](http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/){:target="_blank"} in HCML and bring together a community of diverse practitioners and ideas to articulate an updated agenda for doing human-centered ML research.

In particular, the workshop will host sessions where participants will presents position papers focusing on emerging ideas on **Machine Teaching when people are more than a source of labels** as well as **Intelligible Systems, Explainable Decisions and Algorithmic Fairness**. For more details on this, see the [Call for Papers](https://aka.ms/hcmlperspectives/callforpapers.html) section of this website.

The workshop's final session will take the form of a participatory discussion among the participants and the attendees. During this session we will discuss the best ways to diseminate the outcome of the day's presentations and discussions. Alternatives to this include expanding the day's presentations into longer papers to be included into a special issue, or online venues such as [distill](http://distill.pub){:target="_blank"}.
In addition to the above, we will also discuss how to best mantain and grow the HCML community. We would like to propose the formation on SIG on HCML, and the continuation of workshops in the area in venues focusing on  HCI, Design, and ML themes.
