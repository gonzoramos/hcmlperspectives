---

Machine Learning has developed as a powerful technology that is embedded into thefabric of the systems and processes that affect millions of people. Human-Centered Machine Learning emerges in response to the above, to provide the understandings and means to put ML at the serviceof people in a way that is accessible, useful, and trustworthy to all.

It is within this context that we set our workshopâ€™s goals to continue [past efforts](http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/){:target="_blank"} in the area and articulate an updated agenda for doing human-centered research that focuses in the above emergingperspectives. In particular, we hope to bring together a community of diverse practitioners and ideasconnected by a common set of goals.
