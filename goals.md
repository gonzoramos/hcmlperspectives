title: Workshop Goals.
---

Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML) emerges in response to the rapid adoption of ML, to provide the understandings and means to put ML at the service of people in a way that is accessible, useful, and trustworthy to all. This workshopâ€™s goals are to continue [past efforts](http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/){:target="_blank"} in HCML and bring together a community of diverse practitioners and ideas to articulate an updated agenda for doing human-centered ML research.

In particular, the workshop will host sessions where participants will presents position papers focusing on emerging ideas about **Machine Teaching when people are more than a source of labels** as well as **Intelligible Systems, Explainable Decisions and Algorithmic Fairness**. For more details on these themes, see the [Call for Papers](callforpapers.html) section of this website.

After the paper sessions, panelists and audience will collaborate in participatory design activity to explore one or more ideas that emerged from the prior panels.

The workshop's final event will consists of a town-hall-like discussion among the participants and the attendees. During this event we will discuss the best ways to diseminate the outcome of the day's activities. This includes expanding the day's presentations into longer papers to be included into a special issue of a journal such as TOCHI, or online venues such as [distill](http://distill.pub){:target="_blank"}.
In addition to considering disemination plans, we will discuss how to best mantain and grow the HCML community. We would like to propose the formation on SIG on HCML, and the continuation of workshops in the area in venues focusing on  HCI, Design, and ML themes.
