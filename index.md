title: HCML Perspectives Workshop.
---

Current Machine Learning models have the power to make predictions that are as good as or better than those made by people. The rapid adoption of this technology puts it at the forefront of systems that impact the lives of many. Therefore, work at the intersection of people's needs and ML systems is more relevant than ever.

This area of work, dubbed Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML), re-thinks ML research and systems in terms of human goals. HCML gathers an interdisciplinary group of HCI and ML practitioners, each bringing their unique, yet related perspectives. This workshop is an unapologetic successor of [CHI's 2016 workshop on Human-Centered Machine Learnig] (http://hcml2016.goldsmithsdigital.com/) and focuses on recent advancements and emerging areas in HCML. We aim to discuss different perspectives on these areas and articulate a coordinated research agenda for the XXI century.

This one-day workshop will take place at the [ACM CHI 2019  Conference](http://chi2019.acm.org) in Glasgow, UK.
