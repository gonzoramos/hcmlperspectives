# Call for Papers!

Machine Learning is currently one of the most important technologies used across systems affecting research, commerce, healthcare, entertainment, security, etc.
As its use grows woven into our society, and affecting the lives of people, it has become important to study and design the interactions between ML and its stakeholders from a Human-Centered point of view. Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML) shares this view and re-frames work on and related to ML in term of human goals.
This workshop continues prior workshops on HCML by inviting ideas focusing on, but not limited to the following themes from a HCML point of view:

- Machine Teaching,
- Expressing human knowledge beyond labels: e.g., features, concept decomposition,
- Intelligible, Explainable Systems, and Fair Machine Learning.

By articulating these emerging perspectives, we look at how, as a community, we keep moving the HCML field forward.
We invite the submission of positions papers between 3-6 pages long. Position papers should follow the CHI Extended Abstract format and be submitted through the workshop's submission site available through https://aka.ms/hcmlperspectives. The workshop`s organizing committee will review the submissions. 

Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop. We ask that at least one of the authors of each accepted position paper attends the workshop. Presenting authors must register for the workshop and at least one full day of the conference.
Each presentation will take place within a session focused around a particular theme. Sessions will consist of 3-4 presentations, each lasting approximately 10 minutes and will be followed by a group discussion.
